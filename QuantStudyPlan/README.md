### **Key Considerations**:
1. **Time Management**: You have 1 month, so focus on learning the key techniques and applying them directly to projects.
2. **Hands-on Practice**: Theoretical understanding is important, but **building real-world applications** will set you apart. Emphasize **backtesting** and **portfolio optimization** in your projects.
3. **Optimization**: If you're new to trading or finance, stick to simpler models at first, and gradually move to more complex ones as you learn.
4. **Networking**: As you work through your projects, don’t forget to **engage with the quant finance community**. Share your progress on LinkedIn, GitHub, or relevant forums.
Here's a **1-month plan** to develop a solid portfolio for a **Quantitative Researcher** role:

### **Step 1: Understand the Role**
Quantitative Researchers in trading firms typically focus on:
1. **Mathematical modeling** (probability, stochastic calculus, statistics).
2. **Data analysis** and **statistical inference**.
3. **Machine learning models** (for predictions, portfolio optimization, etc.).
4. **Algorithmic trading strategies** (backtesting, execution algorithms).

### **Step 2: Key Skills & Knowledge Areas**
- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, stochastic processes, optimization, and time-series analysis.
- **Programming**: Proficiency in Python (libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, etc.).
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised/unsupervised learning, deep learning, feature engineering, model evaluation.
- **Financial Knowledge**: Understanding financial instruments (stocks, bonds, derivatives) and how markets function.
- **Algorithmic Trading**: Backtesting, strategy development, risk management.

### **Step 3: Develop a Structured Learning and Portfolio Plan**

#### **Week 1: Core Quantitative & Mathematical Skills**
